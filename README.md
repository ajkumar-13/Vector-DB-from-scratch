## What Is This?

This repository contains a **complete tutorial series** for building a vector database from scratch using Rust. By the end, you'll have built a working system with:

- ⚡ **Sub-millisecond search** using HNSW graphs
- 💾 **Crash recovery** with Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)
- 🗺️ **Memory-mapped storage** for efficient disk I/O
- 🔍 **Hybrid search** combining vectors + metadata filters
- 🌐 **Async HTTP API** with Axum and Tokio
- 📦 **Production-ready** Docker deployment

**No Rust experience required**,  we learn together, concept by concept.

## Why Build a Vector Database?

Vector databases power modern AI applications:

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** — Give LLMs long-term memory
- **Semantic Search** — Find by meaning, not keywords
- **Recommendation Systems** — "Users who liked X also liked Y"
- **Image/Audio Search** — Find similar media content

Everyone *uses* vector databases, but few understand how they work. This series changes that.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need to know Rust?</strong></summary>

**No!** We teach Rust concepts as we need them. If you can program in any language, you can follow along.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why Rust instead of Python/Go/C++?</strong></summary>

- **Python**: Too slow for database internals (10-100× slower)
- **Go**: GC pauses are problematic for latency-sensitive systems
- **C++**: Memory safety bugs cause ~70% of security vulnerabilities
- **Rust**: C++ performance with memory safety guarantees
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why Edition 2021 instead of 2024?</strong></summary>

Edition 2021 is stable, battle-tested, and has full ecosystem support. Edition 2024 adds minor syntax changes that don't affect our project. Both editions are backwards compatible. [Learn more](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How long does the series take?</strong></summary>

Each post takes 30-60 minutes to read and implement. The full series is ~20-30 hours of focused learning.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this code in production?</strong></summary>

**Yes, with the right hardening!** Post #20 covers production deployment including quantization, Docker, CI/CD, and SIMD optimizations. The architecture is designed for real-world use. Start with the tutorial, understand every component, then extend it for your specific needs. You'll have full control over your vector database — no vendor lock-in!
